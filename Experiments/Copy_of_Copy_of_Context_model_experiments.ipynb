[SEP] this work shows that results on clustering parameters, obtained with different group individuation recipes, are essentially consistent. [SEP] this does not mean that the values of the links do not matter. [SEP] [START] different thermal configurations have been tested and only one resonator is completly optimized, the two others recently implemented still need some adjustments. [END]', 'they considered two different operations. [SEP] [START] the first would take the state of a bipartite quantum system and transform it into a state that is just the product of the reduced density matrixes of the two subsystems. [END] [SEP] they showed that while both of these processes are impossible in general, they can be realized for particular sets of input states. [SEP] an approximate disentangler of the first type has been considered by bandyopadhyay, et.', 'this could very well be due to the fact that the pore size in the experiments by brogioli is very small such that ion desolvation, ion polarisability, and image charge effects may be determining the relation between the surface charge and electrostatic potential. [SEP] [START] the small scale of the wavelength opens up the possibility for a new type of thermal noise which has not yet been considered. [END] [SEP] another ingredient in a more detailed description must involve the finite size of the ions combined with the microscopic roughness of the carbon. [SEP] the ions in the solvent and the electrons (holes) in the electrode material can not approach infinitely close, and the resulting charge free zone can be modeled by a stern capacitance.', 'however, if there are multiple intersections then it is necessary to map the original likelihood to know if they are due to degeneracy in the model or were created erroneously by moped. [SEP] [START] the time spent finding the moped likelihood surface can be much less than that which will be needed to map the original likelihood, so relatively little time will have been wasted. [END] [SEP] one possible way of determining the validity of degenerate peaks in the moped likelihood function is to compare the original likelihoods of the peak parameter values with each other. [SEP] we can determine which one is correct. [SEP] the correct peak and any degeneracy in the original likelihood function will yield similar values to one another, but a false peak in the moped likelihood will have a much lower value in the original likelihood and can be ruled out. [SEP] this means that a bayesian evidence calculation can not be obtained from using the moped likelihood; however, the algorithm was not designed to be able to provide this.', 'we determined that only raw lightcurves are suitable as a starting point for work that concentrates in detail on the variability due to stars (that may change with future versions of the pipeline). [SEP] we elect to use a form of differential photometry, produced by dividing each lightcurve by its median value then subtracting unity. [SEP] [START] we next investigated whether the secular trends seen in almost all raw lightcurves have an instrumental component that can be easily distinguished from true stellar variability. [END] [SEP] we made a linear fit to each curve, and examined the slopes as a function of position within a given detector or across the focal plane. [SEP] it is not surprising to find these slopes; the stars drift on the pixels due to pointing errors, positioning of the field, differential velocity aberration, and focal plane distortion due to thermal and other effects. [SEP] the response of each pixel can vary.']\n"

[SEP] this signature has not been exploited yet in the above yields and could be used to reduce the background to a negligible level. [SEP] more detailed simulation studies will be undertaken to optimise the position of the veto stations at the entrance of the decay volume.

[SEP] new terms will be created which involve entanglement of spin states with states that have created phonons. [SEP] [START] if the amplitude of those extra terms is small, they will not have a large effect, but if it is not, shit one has no other recourse but to examine the full problem numerically, which is what we do next.
